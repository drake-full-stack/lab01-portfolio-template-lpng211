[Write your reflection here]

What was the most challenging part?

The most challenging part was getting the CSS file to work properly because, at first, I had the wrong file path.  

What did you learn about semantic HTML?

I learned that semantic HTML makes the structure of a webpage more meaningful by using tags like header, main, and footer. This improves readability for developers and also supports accessibility.

How do you plan to expand this portfolio?

I plan to expand the portfolio by adding CSS styling for an overall better layout, so the site looks better. I also want to include more detailed project pages, images, and interaction.

*This portfolio will grow throughout the semester as you add React components and full-stack projects!*
